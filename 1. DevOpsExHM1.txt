# A

Create a program with the following:
A.
1. Create a variable name first with value 7.
2. Create a variable name second with value 44.3.
3. Print result of adding first to second.
4. Print result of multiplying first by second
5. Print result of dividing second by first


#A1
first = 7
#A2
second = 44.3
#A3
print (first + second)
# 51.3
#A4
print (first / second)
# 0.1580135440180587
#A5
print (second / first)
# 6.328571428571428

# B.
What will be the values of a, b, c at the end?

a=8
a=17
a=9
b=6
c=a+b
b=c+a
b=8

# answers: a=9, b=8, c=15

# C.
Is there a difference between the two lines below? Why?
name = “john”
name= ‘john’

What is the issue with the code below?
my_number = 5+5
print("result is: "+my_number)
Suggest an edit.

#c there is no difference - they both represent str just with a difference comma
#c the issue is that you cannot add int and string (as shown by the console error - TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str)
#c print("result is: ", + my_number) adding a , can solve the issue

#D What will be the output?
x =5
y = 2.36
print(x+int(y))

7 - we set y = int, so we will receive whole number even though y is float. so instated of y=2.36, we get y=2.

# E
E.
1. Create two variables name X and Y.
2. Print “BIG” if X is bigger than Y .
3. Print “small” if X is smaller than Y.

x = 55
y = 105

if x < y:
    print("small")
if x > y:
    print ("BIG")

x = int(input("define X - please enter a number"))
    if x > y:
        print("Big")
    else
        print ("small")

# F.
1. Create a variable and initialize it with a
number 1-4.
2. Create 4 conditions (if-elif) which will check
the variable.
3. print the season name accordingly:
- 1 = summer
- 2 = winter
- 3 = fall
- 4 = spring

x = "summer"
y = "winter"
z = "fall"
w = "spring"

f = int(input("define f - enter a number between 1-4"))
if f == 1:
      print(x)
elif f == 2:
    print(y)
elif f == 3:
    print(z)
else:
    print(w)

# Challenge

Fix the following code, without changing a or b
a = 8
b = "123:
print(a+b)

print (a+int(b))
